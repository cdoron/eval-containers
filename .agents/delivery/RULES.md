# Delivery

**Status:** Active
**Date:** June 2026

## Abstract

How Eval Containers is published — the delivery-specific outcomes that refine the
one-version policy for the moment of release. One SemVer, set by the git tag,
already spans every image, the per-benchmark `eval-<benchmark>` compose
artifacts, the Helm chart, and the Rust CLI (top-level principle 9). These rules
govern how a single tag releases the
image fleet and the CLI together, which workflow owns which artifact, and the
gates that keep a release honest.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Principles

1. **One tag, one release.** A release MUST be a single `vX.Y.Z` git tag that triggers both the image-fleet release and the CLI release.

2. **CLI release home.** The CLI release — binaries, installers, and the crates.io publish — MUST be produced by `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

3. **Fleet release home.** The image-fleet release — every fleet image and the per-benchmark `eval-<benchmark>` compose artifacts (one per benchmark) — MUST be produced by `.github/workflows/release-images.yml`.

4. **One Release owner.** A tag's GitHub Release object MUST be created and owned solely by the CLI release workflow.

5. **Tag-gated publishing.** The crate and the tagged image fleet MUST be published only by a `vX.Y.Z` tag push or an explicit `workflow_dispatch`, never by a branch push.

6. **Version-agreement gate.** A tagged release MUST abort unless the git tag equals both the `Cargo.toml` and `Chart.yaml` versions.

7. **Immutable crate versions.** A published crates.io version MUST NOT be reused or republished.

8. **Release-curated changelog.** `CHANGELOG.md` MUST be updated only when cutting a release tag.

9. **Standard sections only.** `CHANGELOG.md` MUST contain only the Keep a Changelog sections: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, and Security.

10. **Consumer-visible entries only.** A `CHANGELOG.md` entry MUST record a change visible to a consumer of a release.

11. **Build inputs.** An image's build inputs MUST comprise its build context, the build inputs of every in-repo base image, and the resolved digests of its external base images.

12. **Recorded inputs.** Every published image MUST record a hash of its build inputs in its image configuration.

13. **Carried-forward images.** A released image whose build inputs are unchanged from a prior release MUST be retagged from that release's digest rather than rebuilt.

14. **Fail dirty.** An image whose recorded build-input hash is absent, unreadable, or different from the repository's computed hash MUST be treated as changed.

15. **Gate parity.** A carried-forward image MUST pass every release gate that a freshly built image passes.

## Changelog

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-06-11 | Initial version. Lifts the unified fleet + CLI release outcomes out of the root `RELEASE.md` into the delivery topic, which had skills but no `RULES.md`. |
| 2026-06-11 | Rule 5: permit an explicit `workflow_dispatch` (manual re-run with a version input) alongside a tag push — the fleet workflow's escape hatch; still forbids branch-push publishes. |
| 2026-06-14 | Added principles 8–10: the changelog is edited only when cutting a release tag, restricted to the Keep a Changelog sections, and limited to consumer-visible changes. |
| 2026-08-09 | Added rules 11–15 (build inputs, recorded inputs, carried-forward images, fail dirty, gate parity): a release carries an unchanged image's digest forward instead of rebuilding it, keyed on a recorded build-input hash that fails dirty and exempts nothing from release gates. Defining inputs to include resolved external-base digests makes an upstream base bump a *changed* input, so CVE refreshes rebuild naturally. Supersedes the judgment-based `skip_published` dispatch knob (#227); answers the silent-staleness objection that closed #241 (content hash, not path mapping) and implements the change-detection follow-up blessed in #168. |
| 2026-06-14 | Rule 3 + Abstract: the single shared `evaluate` compose artifact is replaced by per-benchmark `eval-<benchmark>` artifacts (one self-contained compose per benchmark, flattened at publish). A published artifact can't carry a dynamic per-benchmark `include:` (publish flattens includes), so per-benchmark sidecars (EnterpriseOps-Gym, WebArena, …) are baked in at publish and consumed with a single `-f`. |
