# Environment variables

*Reference · for operators · derives from `src/run.rs` and [`.agents/src/RULES.md`](../../.agents/src/RULES.md). This page is the authoritative list of `EVAL_*` variables.*

All Eval Containers variables are prefixed `EVAL_` to avoid collision with CI
systems, orchestrators, and user scripts. Every variable has a matching
`--kebab-case` CLI flag (see [CLI reference](cli.md)); the flag overrides the
env var.

## Axis selection

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `EVAL_BENCHMARK` | Which benchmark to run | — |
| `EVAL_AGENT` | Which agent to run | — |
| `EVAL_MODEL` | LiteLLM handle `<provider>/<model>` the gateway routes to (e.g. `openai/gpt-5.4`) — **required**, must be `<provider>/<model>` form | — |
| `EVAL_TASK_ID` | Which task within the benchmark | `0` |
| `EVAL_GATEWAY_IMAGE` | Which proxy backend serves the model | `bifrost` |

`EVAL_MODEL` is a *runtime handle, not an image*: any LiteLLM-supported
provider/model works with no per-model build — the generic gateway
(`EVAL_GATEWAY_IMAGE`, default `bifrost`; also `litellm`, `portkey`) routes it.
Or set `EVAL_GATEWAY_IMAGE` to a **pinned per-model image** (e.g. `gpt-5.4`) — a
baked, shared artifact that ignores `EVAL_MODEL`. Both are pull-not-build; see
[Use a model](../guides/add-a-model.md).

## Container versions — *which image tag to pull*

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `EVAL_BENCHMARK_TAG` | Benchmark container version | `latest` |
| `EVAL_AGENT_TAG` | Agent container version | `latest` |
| `EVAL_MODEL_TAG` | Model container version | `latest` |

## Internal software versions — *what runs inside the container*

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `EVAL_BENCHMARK_VERSION` | Dataset revision inside the benchmark | built-in pin |
| `EVAL_AGENT_VERSION` | Upstream CLI version inside the agent | built-in pin |
| `EVAL_LITELLM_VERSION` | LiteLLM version inside the model | built-in pin |

## Runtime

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `EVAL_TIMEOUT` | Agent timeout in seconds | `300` |
| `EVAL_MODEL_MAX_BUDGET` | Hard cap on model spend (USD) for this run | `1` |
| `EVAL_AGENT_REASONING_EFFORT` | Reasoning effort the agent applies (`low`/`medium`/`high`; some also accept `xhigh`/`max`) | agent default |
| `EVAL_REGISTRY` | Registry to pull from | `ghcr.io/exgentic` |
| `EVAL_EXECUTOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | Inline executor system-prompt addition | unset |
| `EVAL_EXECUTOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT_VARIANT` | Named executor prompt in `EVAL_ADVISORY_CONFIG` | unset |
| `EVAL_ADVISORY_CONFIG` | JSON catalog with named executor prompts, advisor prompts, and tool descriptions | unset |
| `EVAL_ADVISOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | Inline advisor system prompt | built-in prompt |
| `EVAL_ADVISOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT_VARIANT` | Named advisor prompt in `EVAL_ADVISORY_CONFIG` | unset |
| `EVAL_ADVISOR_TOOL_DESCRIPTION` | Inline advisory-tool description | unset |
| `EVAL_ADVISOR_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_VARIANT` | Built-in or external named tool description | `neutral` |
| `EVAL_ADVISOR_CONTEXT_MODE` | Advisor input source: `agent-provided` or `full-session` | `agent-provided` |
| `EVAL_ADVISOR_FULL_CONTEXT_MAX_BYTES` | Serialized full-session limit; overflow fails, `0` is unlimited | `0` |

Advisor-specific runtime variables are loaded only by the
`opencode-advisory` Compose overlay. Experimental prompt and description
settings use the `EVAL_*` variables above. Service settings are
`ADVISOR_MODEL`, `ADVISOR_BASE_URL`, `ADVISOR_API_KEY`,
`ADVISORY_EXPERIMENT_ID`, and `ADVISOR_LOG_PAYLOADS`. `OPENAI_API_BASE` and
`OPENAI_API_KEY` configure the executor gateway; the `ADVISOR_*` endpoint and
key configure only the advisor sidecar. Set both pairs explicitly in `.env`;
neither pair inherits from the other. Advisor calls emit separate role-tagged
spans with their input/output messages, model, and input/output token usage.
Experiment JSON deliberately excludes secrets.

Supported agents: **codex, claude-code, claude-code-rtk, aider, cline,
copilot-cli, openclaw**. Setting it for any other agent **fails loud** (the run
exits non-zero) rather than silently ignoring it.

The two version axes are orthogonal: the **tag** controls which container to
pull (Docker-native), the **version** is a runtime override the entrypoint
installs at container start. Every image ships a reproducible default, so casual
users never set these — see [Overview → Two version axes](../concepts/overview.md).
